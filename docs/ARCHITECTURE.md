# Architecture Overview

AutoSwarm Office is a gamified multi-agent business orchestration platform built as a
polyglot monorepo with TypeScript frontend services and Python backend services.

### Service Responsibilities

| Service | Technology | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Office UI** | Next.js 14, Phaser 3, React | Spatial 2D office environment, agent dashboards, approval modals |
| **Nexus API** | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic | Central REST API, WebSocket hub, auth middleware, task dispatch |
| **Colyseus** | Colyseus (Node.js) | Real-time game state synchronization for the spatial office |
| **Workers** | LangGraph, Python | Execute agent tasks in isolated environments with HITL interrupts |
| **Gateway** | OpenClaw (Node.js) | Persistent daemon for scheduled heartbeats and memory management |
| **PostgreSQL** | PostgreSQL 16 | Persistent storage for agents, departments, tasks, approvals, ledger |
| **Redis** | Redis 7 | Task queue (`autoswarm:tasks`), pub/sub for real-time events, caching |

## Data Flow

The primary interaction loop follows this path:

```
User Input (Gamepad)
    |
    v
Phaser Game Loop (Office UI)
    |
    v
Colyseus Room (state sync to all connected clients)
    |
    v
Nexus API (REST endpoint or WebSocket message)
    |
    v
Redis Task Queue (LPUSH to autoswarm:tasks)
    |
    v
Worker Process (XREADGROUP from stream)
    |
    v
PATCH task status to "running" (fire-and-forget via task_status.py)
    |
    v
LangGraph Execution (agent graph with tool nodes)
    |  Coding: plan -> implement -> test -> review -> push_gate
    |  implement() writes files to worktree after permission check
    |  push_gate() commits + pushes on approval
    v
Permission Check (check_permission() evaluates action category)
    |
    v
PATCH task status to "completed" or "failed" with result
    |
    +-- ALLOW --> Execute immediately, report result
    |
    +-- ASK ----> LangGraph interrupt() pauses execution
                      |
                      v
                  Nexus API creates ApprovalRequest row
                      |
                      v
                  WebSocket broadcasts {type: "approval_request"} to Office UI
                      |
                      v
                  Alert icon appears on agent avatar in Phaser
                      |
                      v
                  Tactician walks to agent, presses A (approve) or B (deny)
                      |
                      v
                  POST /api/v1/approvals/{id}/approve or /deny
                      |
                      v
                  Worker resumes (approved) or aborts (denied)
```

## Technology Rationale

| Choice | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Phaser 3** | MIT-licensed 2D game engine with mature tilemap support and gamepad API integration |
| **Colyseus** | MIT-licensed WebSocket framework designed for real-time multiplayer state sync |
| **FastAPI** | High-performance async Python framework with automatic OpenAPI docs and Pydantic validation |
| **LangGraph** | MIT-licensed framework for cyclic multi-agent workflows with native interrupt() support |
| **SQLAlchemy** | Industry-standard Python ORM with async support and strong typing |
| **Turborepo** | Monorepo build orchestration with intelligent caching for TypeScript packages |
| **UV** | Fast Python package manager with workspace support for Python packages |
| **pnpm** | Efficient Node.js package manager with workspace support and strict dependency management |

## Port Assignments

All ports are scoped to avoid conflicts with sibling MADFAM services
(Janua uses 4100-4104, Enclii uses 4200-4204).

| Port | Service | Protocol |
|------|---------|----------|
| 4300 | nexus-api | HTTP/WebSocket |
| 4301 | office-ui | HTTP |
| 4302 | admin dashboard | HTTP |
| 4303 | colyseus | WebSocket |
| 4304 | gateway | Background worker (no HTTP) |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL | TCP |
| 6379 | Redis | TCP |
