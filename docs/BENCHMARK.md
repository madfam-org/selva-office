# Selva Competitive Benchmark — Virtual Office Platforms

> Last updated: April 2026
> Reference: [ro.am/virtual-office-platform](https://ro.am/virtual-office-platform)

## Executive Summary

Selva is not a virtual office for humans pretending to be in the same room. **Selva is a virtual office where AI agents work autonomously, with humans supervising via a game-like interface.** This puts it in a fundamentally different category than Roam, Gather, or Kumospace — those platforms optimize for human-to-human presence; Selva optimizes for human-to-AI orchestration with autonomous execution.

No competitor has: a 10-agent AI workforce, autonomous task dispatch via CRM-driven playbooks, LLM inference with tool execution, a permission engine with HITL approval gates, or a Factory-as-a-Product phygital pipeline.

## Pricing Positioning

| Platform | Per-Seat/Month | What You Get |
|----------|:--------------:|-------------|
| SoWork | $6-15 | Virtual office presence |
| WorkAdventure | $0-5 | Open-source spatial office |
| Gather | $7+ | Pixel-art spatial office with free tier |
| Sococo | $13-25 | Floor plan presence for Zoom users |
| Kumospace | $16+ | Photorealistic spatial office |
| Roam | $19.50 | 9-product suite (chat, video, AI, events) |
| Teamflow | $0-30 | Minimal bubble presence |
| **Selva** | **$149-499** | **10 AI agents that code, email, deploy, file taxes, and generate revenue autonomously** |

Selva's pricing is 7-25x higher because it's not selling presence — it's selling an autonomous workforce that replaces headcount.

## Category Analysis

### Where Selva Wins (No Competitor Matches)

1. **Autonomous AI Workforce** — 10 specialized agents executing tasks without human intervention (bounded by playbooks)
2. **Revenue Loop Automation** — CRM → lead detection → email → checkout → payment. Autonomous monetization.
3. **14-Platform Ecosystem** — Not just a virtual office but an entire business operating system
4. **Permission Engine** — Bounded autonomous execution with action allowlists, token budgets, financial caps
5. **Full-Stack DevOps** — Agents push code, create PRs, deploy, scale infrastructure

### Where Competitors Win (Selva's Gaps)

1. **Human-to-Human Presence** — Roam/Gather excel at making remote teams feel together. Selva's humans are supervisors, not collaborators.
2. **Video Quality** — Roam is enterprise-grade. Selva uses simple-peer (functional but not polished).
3. **Game Room** — Roam has 18 games. Selva is for work.
4. **Pricing Accessibility** — Gather is free. Selva requires meaningful investment.
5. **Native Mobile App** — Roam/Gather have iOS/Android. Selva is PWA-only.
6. **Enterprise Admin** — Roam has mature SCIM, analytics, admin controls.

### Where Selva Is Categorically Different

Selva doesn't compete with Gather for pixel art. It competes with:
- **GitHub Copilot Workspace** — AI development
- **CrewAI / LangGraph** — multi-agent orchestration
- **Salesforce Einstein** — autonomous CRM
- **ServiceNow AI Agents** — autonomous IT operations

The virtual office is the control plane. The product is autonomous operations.

## Roadmap: Closing Gaps

| Gap | Priority | Plan |
|-----|----------|------|
| 3D Voxel View | Phase 1 | React Three Fiber + MagicaVoxel (`ROADMAP_3D_VOXEL.md`) |
| Native Mobile | Phase 2 | React Native wrapper |
| Video Quality | Phase 2 | LiveKit SFU (staged) |
| SCIM | Phase 3 | Janua SCIM endpoints |
| Game Room | Low | Not core to AI workforce |

*Selva — not a virtual office that has AI. An AI workforce that has a virtual office.*
