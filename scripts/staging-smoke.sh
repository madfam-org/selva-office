# PP.4 — staging smoke test for autoswarm-office.
#
# Hits /health (or equivalent) on each of the 5 HTTP-exposed services
# in the autoswarm-office staging tier. Workers is not HTTP-exposed
# externally — its health is checked by whether the dependent services
# stay healthy (workers process tasks from Redis and update task
# status on nexus-api; an unhealthy workers pod manifests as stuck
# `running` tasks, which is out-of-band monitoring).
#
# Retry profile matches Karafiel + Dhanam: 6 attempts x 20s gap.
# Rolling restart on a 6-pod deploy can briefly 502 before the new
# pod passes readiness, so retries are non-negotiable.
#
# Env vars (all optional — defaults shown):

#   STAGING_WS_URL     https://staging-ws.selva.town
#   STAGING_GW_URL     https://staging-gw.selva.town
#
# Exit 0 if all services pass, 1 otherwise.
