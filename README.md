# Selva

Gamified multi-agent business orchestration platform. Manage your digital enterprise
as an Auto Chess-style RPG -- draft AI agents, assign them to departments, and approve
their actions from a 2D virtual office using a gamepad.

## Architecture

Selva is a polyglot monorepo with TypeScript frontends and Python backends.

```
Office UI (Next.js + Phaser) <---> Colyseus (real-time state sync)
         |
    Nexus API (FastAPI) <---> Workers (LangGraph)
         |                         |
    PostgreSQL              Redis (task queue)
                                   |
                              Gateway (OpenClaw heartbeats)
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full component diagram and
data flow documentation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run first-time setup
bash scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Start PostgreSQL and Redis
make docker-dev

# 3. Start all services
make dev
```

### Python Packages (`packages/`)

- `selva-redis-pool`: Standardized Redis dependency for async pub/sub and distributed locking.
- `selva-permissions`: A strict Janua RBAC dependency injecting local Fastapi Role assertions globally.
- `selva-orchestrator`: Interacts closely with the Enclii platform lifecycle templates.
- `selva-workflows`: The gamified Langgraph architecture executing autonomous workflows.
- `selva-skills`: Procedural skills registry built from continuous learning loops.

## MADFAM Ecosystem

Selva is part of the MADFAM platform and integrates with:

- **Janua** -- OpenID Connect authentication (ports 4100-4104)
- **Dhanam** -- Billing, subscriptions, and compute token budgets
- **Enclii** -- Deployment orchestration via ArgoCD (ports 4200-4204)

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Use conventional commits: `feat(scope): description`, `fix(scope): description`.
3. Open a pull request -- CI must pass before merge.
4. Commits are enforced by commitlint via husky pre-commit hooks.
