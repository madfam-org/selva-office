# Selva Office

Selva Office is an agent and inference platform. Treat autonomous worker
dispatch, tool execution, social posting, email/marketing send, GitHub writes,
database writes, provider API calls, load tests, deploys, promotions, and
rollbacks as side-effectful operations. Use Enclii/Vault as the normal
production operations path, keep examples placeholder-only, and do not run
production or tenant-impacting actions without an explicit environment and
operator request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MADFAM-ENCLII-FIRST-LEGACY-RAW v1: This document contains legacy raw infrastructure command examples.
> Routine production operations must use Enclii web, API, or CLI. Treat raw
> `kubectl`, `helm`, SSH, provider CLI/API, `docker exec`, and direct container
> access as platform bootstrap or documented break-glass only, and record any
> missing Enclii adapter gap.


Gamified multi-agent business orchestration platform. Manage your digital enterprise
as an Auto Chess-style RPG -- draft AI agents, assign them to departments, and approve
their actions from a 2D virtual office using a gamepad.

## Architecture

Selva Office is a polyglot monorepo with TypeScript frontends and Python backends.

```
Office UI (Next.js + Phaser) <---> Colyseus (real-time state sync)
         |
    Nexus API (FastAPI) <---> Workers (LangGraph)
         |                         |
    PostgreSQL              Redis (task queue)
                                   |
                              Gateway (OpenClaw heartbeats)
```

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full component diagram and
data flow documentation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run first-time setup
bash scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Start PostgreSQL and Redis
make docker-dev

# 3. Start all services
make dev
```

## Role in the MADFAM monetization engine

Selva Office sits in MADFAM's commercial pipeline in two ways.

- **Inference gateway.** It is the ecosystem's centralized LLM inference path. Other MADFAM platforms call Selva
  rather than each holding their own model credentials, which is what makes model spend measurable and governable
  in one place instead of scattered across services.
- **Human approval.** It hosts the human-in-the-loop workflows where machine-generated proposals are reviewed. An
  agent can propose; a person approves or rejects, and the proposal does not take effect until they do. In a
  pipeline that is otherwise automated end to end, this is the deliberate place where a human stays in the loop on
  commercially consequential changes.

Selva Office is also a MADFAM product in its own right, with its tier definitions codified in
[`infra/pricing/selva-tiers.json`](infra/pricing/selva-tiers.json). Current availability and prices are whatever
the public pricing page shows; this document does not restate them.

The approval mechanics are documented in [Human-in-the-Loop Flow](docs/HITL_FLOW.md).

> **Boundary note.** This is a deliberately sanitized summary of the repository's *designed* role. It is not a
> statement about the live state of any deployment. The canonical end-to-end description of the monetization
> pipeline is private and lives in the `internal-devops` repository at `docs/monetization-engine.md`. Which
> downstream systems accept an approved proposal, endpoint and route detail, credential names, and deployment
> topology belong there and must not be added to this repository.

## Outbound Reddit Posting (operator runbook)

Tenant swarms can submit text posts to a single subreddit via the
`reddit_post` tool (`packages/tools/src/selva_tools/builtins/reddit_tools.py`).
The tool is gated by:

1. **Mandatory creds** — env vars `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`,
   `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`, `REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN`. Missing any one raises
   `ToolNotConfiguredError` (no placeholder ever shipped).
2. **Per-subreddit policy ConfigMap** — mounted at
   `/etc/selva/subreddit_policies.yaml` (sample at
   `infra/k8s/configmaps/subreddit-policies-default.yaml`). Default for
   any unlisted subreddit: `disclosure_required: true`.
3. **Mandatory AI disclosure footer** — appended automatically when the
   per-subreddit policy requires it. Idempotent — agents that
   pre-stamp the footer are not double-stamped.
4. **30-min Redis rate-limit per subreddit** — `selva:reddit:last_post:{subreddit}`
   key with 30-min TTL.
5. **HITL gate via the `reddit_promo_v1` built-in playbook** —
   `require_approval=True`, `financial_cap_cents=0`, `token_budget=20_000`.

### Operator provisioning steps

1. Create a Reddit "script-type" OAuth app at
   <https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps>.
2. Use the script-app installed-flow to mint a refresh token (see PRAW
   docs).
3. Store the four secrets in Vault, sync to the `selva` namespace
   K8s Secret used by the worker Deployment.
4. `kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/configmaps/subreddit-policies-default.yaml`
   to ship the policy ConfigMap.
5. Mount the ConfigMap on workers + nexus-api. Bump the worker
   Deployment annotation to force re-roll on policy changes.
6. Publish a real disclosure page at <https://madfam.io/ai-disclosure>
   before going live (the footer URL is a placeholder until then).

`X` (Twitter), LinkedIn, and crossposting are explicitly out of scope
for this MVP.

## Outbound Bluesky / AT Protocol Posting (operator runbook)

Tenant swarms can submit text posts to Bluesky via the `bluesky_post`
tool (`packages/tools/src/selva_tools/builtins/bluesky_tools.py`). The
tool mirrors the Reddit MVP shape and is gated by:

1. **Mandatory per-persona credentials** — env vars
   `BLUESKY_HANDLE_<PERSONA_ID>` (e.g. `madfam.bsky.social`) and
   `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD_<PERSONA_ID>` (16-char app password,
   NOT the account login password). Missing either raises
   `ToolNotConfiguredError` (no placeholder ever shipped).
2. **300-character hard limit, including the disclosure footer** —
   Bluesky's per-post limit is 300 chars. The mandatory disclosure
   footer is ~36 chars, leaving ~264 chars for promo content. If user
   text alone overflows 300, or text + footer overflows, the tool
   raises `PostTooLongError` (no silent truncation — agent must
   rewrite tighter). Document any longer drafts as a thread-of-replies
   (out of scope for v1; v2 ships threading helpers).
3. **Mandatory AI disclosure footer** — every post gets the suffix
   `\n\n— Posted by an AI agent on behalf of MADFAM` appended
   automatically. Idempotent — agents that pre-stamp the footer are
   not double-stamped.
4. **30-min Redis rate-limit per persona** —
   `selva:bluesky:last_post:{persona_id}` key with 30-min TTL.
   Bluesky's underlying API limit is high (5000 points/hr); the
   conservative cadence here is for promo content, not API hygiene.
5. **`langs` field** — default `["en"]`. Pass `langs=["es"]` for
   Karafiel/Dhanam Spanish promo copy so Bluesky's discovery feeds
   surface the post to the right audience.
6. **HITL gate via the `bluesky_promo_v1` built-in playbook** —
   `require_approval=True`, `financial_cap_cents=0`,
   `token_budget=20_000`.

### Operator provisioning steps

1. For each persona that will post (e.g. `default`, `growth-bot-1`,
   `karafiel-es`), log in to <https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords>
   under the persona's Bluesky account.
2. Generate a NEW app password (16 chars, displayed once). Treat it
   like an API token — rotate quarterly per
   `docs/SECRET_ROTATION_POLICY.md`.
3. Store the handle + app password as Vault secrets, sync to the
   `selva` namespace K8s Secret used by the worker Deployment.
   Naming convention:
   - `BLUESKY_HANDLE_DEFAULT` = `madfam.bsky.social`
   - `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD_DEFAULT` = `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`
   - (uppercase + hyphens replaced with underscores)
4. Install the `bluesky` extra in the worker image:
   `pip install selva-tools[bluesky]` (pulls in `atproto>=0.0.46`).
5. Quote-posts, image attachments, and threading are explicitly out
   of scope for this v1; v2 will add them.

`X` (Twitter) parity is still tracked in ROADMAP. Bluesky's tech-
leaning audience fits Selva (B2B founders/CTOs) and Yantra4D
(technical maker community) — that's why we ship it before X.

## Outbound Mastodon Posting (operator runbook)

Tenant swarms can submit a status (toot) to a Mastodon instance via the
`mastodon_post` tool
(`packages/tools/src/selva_tools/builtins/mastodon_tools.py`). The tool
mirrors the Reddit pattern's defense-in-depth and adds a few
fediverse-specific gates:

1. **Per-persona access tokens** — env vars `MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL`
   (shared) and `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN_<PERSONA_ID>` (per persona,
   upper-cased + non-alphanumerics replaced with underscores).
   Missing either raises `ToolNotConfiguredError` (no placeholder
   ever shipped).
2. **Per-instance policy ConfigMap** — mounted at
   `/etc/selva/mastodon_policies.yaml` (sample at
   `infra/k8s/configmaps/mastodon-policies-default.yaml`). Default
   for any unlisted instance: `disclosure_required: true`,
   `allowed_visibilities: ["unlisted"]`, `rate_limit_minutes: 30`.
3. **Default visibility = `unlisted`** — accessible by URL but absent
   from the local + federated public timelines. The fediverse social
   contract is significantly more sensitive to public-timeline promo
   spam than Reddit's subreddit model. Per-instance policy can pin it
   stricter; ops must opt-in to `public` per instance after the
   moderators have approved the bot account.
4. **Mandatory AI disclosure footer** — appended automatically when
   the per-instance policy requires it (default: always). Idempotent.
5. **Per-instance Redis rate-limit** — `selva:mastodon:last_post:{instance}`
   key with the configured TTL (default 30 min, per-instance override
   possible — fosstodon.org defaults to 60 min).
6. **HITL gate via the `mastodon_promo_v1` built-in playbook** —
   `require_approval=True`, `financial_cap_cents=0`,
   `token_budget=20_000`.

### Provisioning per-persona Mastodon access tokens

For each persona that will post from a given instance:

1. Sign in to the persona's account on the target instance (e.g.
   <https://mastodon.social/>).
2. Navigate to **Settings → Development → New application**.
3. Set the application name (e.g. `selva-growth-bot`) and grant the
   `write:statuses` scope. Other scopes are not required for text
   posts.
4. Copy the resulting **access token** (NOT the client id / client
   secret — Mastodon tokens for owned-account use are a single long-
   lived bearer string).
5. Store the token in Vault under
   `mastodon/access_token/<persona_id>`. Selva's Vault → K8s Secret
   sync materialises it on the worker Deployment as
   `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN_<PERSONA_ID>` (upper-cased, non-alphanumerics
   → `_`).
6. Set `MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL` once per worker Deployment to the home
   instance's base URL (e.g. `https://mastodon.social`).
7. `kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/configmaps/mastodon-policies-default.yaml`
   to ship the policy ConfigMap; mount it on workers + nexus-api at
   `/etc/selva/mastodon_policies.yaml`. Bump the worker Deployment
   annotation to force re-roll on policy changes.
8. Publish a real disclosure page at
   <https://madfam.io/ai-disclosure> before going live (the footer
   URL is a placeholder until then; same caveat as the Reddit tool).

`X` (Twitter) and LinkedIn parity tracked separately.

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Use conventional commits: `feat(scope): description`, `fix(scope): description`.
3. Open a pull request -- CI must pass before merge.
4. Commit messages are checked by commitlint from a husky `commit-msg` hook,
   installed automatically by `pnpm install`. Scopes are free-form; the type
   must be one of the list in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-messages).
