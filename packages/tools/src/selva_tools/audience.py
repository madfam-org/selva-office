"""Tool-level audience split — platform (MADFAM) vs tenant swarms.

Two-layer defense:

- **Spec-time filter** (primary): ``ToolRegistry.get_specs(audience=...)``
  strips PLATFORM tools when the swarm is tenant-audience. The LLM
  literally can't call what it can't see.
- **Execute-time guard** (belt-and-braces): ``enforce_audience(tool)``
  reads the current audience from a ContextVar and raises
  ``AudienceMismatch`` if a platform tool is invoked in tenant context.

Superset relationship: PLATFORM sees all tools; TENANT sees only
TENANT-tagged tools. No separate SHARED bucket — platform is a superset.

Default for ``BaseTool.audience`` is ``TENANT`` so new tools don't
accidentally reserve themselves to platform. Dangerous tools must be
opted-in to PLATFORM explicitly. A regression test enumerates the
known-dangerous tools and asserts they're tagged.
