    **Sensitivity is evaluated FIRST and is never overridable.** The
    allowed provider set for the request's sensitivity level is computed
    before anything else; every later rule can only pick *within* that
    set, never outside it.

    Routing rules (applied in order):
    1. **Sensitivity gate** — compute the allowed provider set:
       ``restricted`` / ``confidential`` -> ``[LOCAL_PROVIDER]`` only;
       ``internal`` -> CLOUD_PRIORITY; ``public`` -> CHEAPEST_PRIORITY.
       ``require_local=True`` narrows the set to the local provider.
       A server-set ``provider_allowlist`` (a tenant task exception)
       narrows a cloud-eligible request to the allowlist intersected with
       CLOUD_PRIORITY, in the allowlist's order; it never applies to
       ``restricted`` / ``confidential`` / ``require_local``.
    2. ``task_type`` — if the org config has a model assignment for the
       request's task type **and that assignment's provider is inside the
       allowed set**, jump to it and override the model name. An
       assignment pointing outside the allowed set is REFUSED (logged at
       WARNING) and routing falls through to the sensitivity-derived
       candidates. This is what stops a ``model_assignments`` entry from
       silently sending clinical ``restricted`` data to a cloud vendor.
       Under a ``provider_allowlist`` assignments are not consulted at all:
       the exception pins its own providers, order and models.
    3. Otherwise take the first registered provider in the allowed set.
    4. ``prefer_local=True`` moves the local provider first *within* the
       allowed set (it can never add it to a set that excludes it). It is
       ignored under a ``provider_allowlist``, which is exact.

    If no provider in the allowed set is registered, the router raises —
    it never widens the set to find something that answers.
