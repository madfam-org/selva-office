"""Per-tenant inference policy — sensitivity floor, caps, and rate limits.

The gateway's org-config (``org-config.yaml``) is *ecosystem-wide*: it
says which provider serves which task type. This module adds the missing
*per-tenant* layer: what a given ``X-Selva-Tenant-Org`` is allowed and
budgeted to do.

Why it exists
-------------
Before this, a tenant handling regulated personal data depended entirely
on its own client code sending ``X-Sensitivity: restricted`` on every call. A dropped header, a
proxy that strips it, or a new surface that forgets it, and the request
silently degraded to ``public`` and went to a cloud vendor. The header is
now mandatory (the proxy rejects a request without it), and on top of that
a tenant can declare a **sensitivity floor**: the level its data can never
fall below, enforced server-side regardless of what the client sends.

Design notes
------------
- **Declarative, not code.** Policies load from YAML (``TENANT_POLICY_PATH``,
  shipped as a ConfigMap) so onboarding a regulated tenant is a config
  change reviewed in Git, not a deploy of new logic.
- **Absent policy = no extra restriction.** A tenant with no entry keeps
  today's behaviour exactly. This module only ever *tightens*.
- **The floor raises, never lowers.** A tenant with floor ``restricted``
  that sends ``public`` is served as ``restricted``. A tenant with floor
  ``internal`` that sends ``restricted`` is served as ``restricted`` —
  the caller may always ask for MORE protection than its floor.
- **Rate limiting is in-process** (per pod, fixed window). It is a blunt
  abuse/runaway brake, not a billing meter; the durable USD attribution is
  the ``inference_usage_ledger``. With N replicas the effective limit is
  N × the configured value — state that when you set the number.

No prompt or completion text ever reaches this module.
