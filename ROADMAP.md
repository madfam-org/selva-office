## Autonomous Operations Program (2026-05-30)

Canonical plan: [docs/AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS_PROGRAM.md](docs/AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS_PROGRAM.md).

| Phase | Focus | Horizon | Gate |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| **0** | Ops foundation (OTel, Sentry, Dhanam map, k6 Run 4b, DR, staging) | 2–3 wk | [PHASE_0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md](docs/PHASE_0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md) exit checklist |
| **1** | Closed revenue loop live (CRM → email → Stripe → CFDI) | 3–4 wk | One attributed paid conversion |
| **2** | Tulana campaign orchestration | **API ✅** / UI soak optional | `./scripts/verify-campaign-loop.sh --staging` green |
| **3** | Phygital E2E graph | 6–8 wk | Recorded design → invoice demo |
| **4** | Compliance-grade (SAT, LFPDPPP, CDC, residency) | 6–10 wk | Audit trail + consent + region answerable |
| **5** | Multi-tenant GTM at scale | 8–12 wk | SSO, white-label, paying Karafiel wedge |
| **6** | Autonomy graduation (ASK → ALLOW) | Ongoing | Per-lane 30d clean-run policy |

Program summary: Phase 0 establishes commercial-GA operating proof; Phase 6
graduates specific autonomy lanes from ASK to ALLOW after clean-run evidence.

**Baseline → north star:** MADFAM platform slice ~85–90%; production-truthful Selva ~88–92%; full autonomous digital ops **~58–65%** (readback update 2026-06-04). Target ~95%+ engineering completion in 6–9 months; 100% includes GTM traction (Phase 5).

### GA readiness snapshot (2026-06-04)

| Scope | Current state | What still blocks full GA |
|---|---|---|
| MADFAM tenant slice (`admin@madfam.io`) in prod | **~85–90%** | Keep observability hardening, billing provenance, and load calibration evidence on a strict schedule |
| Production-truthful Selva across current tenants | **~88–92%** | Attribution closure, DR proof, and cross-service audit completion |
| Full commercial GA for all users/tenants | **~58–65%** | Stable evidence chain for money, reliability, recovery, and governance |

The practical delta is mainly operational, but the 2026-06-04 ingestion also
surfaced a small set of commercial-GA no-go implementation gaps. Before broad
tenant GA, gateway and realtime service-token calls must consistently carry
tenant context, gateway auto-dispatch rules must match API-accepted graph
types, and live UI paths must not rely on demo placeholders.

2026-06-04 implementation update: GA-001 through GA-008 from the commercial
GA remediation contract are implemented, tested, or explicitly documented at
the repo level. The operational evidence gates below remain open.

Phase 0 and Phase 1 gates are now the highest-leverage path to close this gap:

1. **Immediate GA correctness hardening** — tenant header propagation,
   gateway graph-type contract, placeholder-free live paths
2. **Observability foundation (OTel + Sentry + actioning alerts)**
3. **Dhanam price-tier mapping + webhook correctness (proven attribution)**
4. **Load/run calibration (Run 4b `staging-load` overlay + queue/deadline tuning)**
5. **Backup/restore RTO+RPO evidence**
6. **CDC + A2A hardening in later phases**

### Coupler consumer track (P3, Oct 2026)

Delegated SaaS tools (Slack, Gmail, GitHub-as-user) route through **Coupler** (`madfam-org/coupler`), not new Selva adapters.

| Milestone | Target | Doc |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| `CouplerToolBackend` PoC | 2026-10-03 | [COUPLER_INTEGRATION.md](docs/COUPLER_INTEGRATION.md) |
| Feature-flagged agent graph wiring | 2026-10-17 | Coupler P3 gate |
| Replace direct SaaS calls in adapters | 2026-11-14 | Coupler P4 |

**Does not replace** 268 built-ins or ecosystem adapters (Dhanam, PhyndCRM, etc.).

Factory-as-a-Product (F1–F5) and Enterprise Autonomy (E1–E6) sections below map into program Phases 1–5 — use the program doc for sequencing and exit gates.

## Current Status: v2.5.0 — monetization spine + engagement UI (2026-07-19) ✅

> Thirteen PRs (#232–#246) merged to `main` on 2026-07-19. Selva went from
> "can meter but cannot collect" to a complete, **wired revenue loop**: a
> First-Peso checkout (`/pricing` + `POST /billing/checkout`, flip-on-ready),
> a one-click **M2 upgrade moment** on the dispatch 402, and **M3 metered
> agent-hours** accrual (`AgentHoursLedger`, migration 0040) for the
> Tulana-priced SKU. The HUD compute-token meter now reads real
> `/billing/tokens` data (was hardcoded to a fake zero). Two public surfaces
> were hardened — the `/metrics` API-surface map is no longer publicly
> scrapable (#233) and `www.selva.town` now 301-redirects to the apex
> (#234). Four **E1 engagement surfaces** shipped: space roster, welcome
> tour, ⌘K command palette, and office-size onboarding with a live
> procedural preview (first real consumer of `@selva/map-gen`). Office-size
> is now server-persisted (migration 0041). See
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[2.5.0]`.
> **Still operator-gated:** apply migrations 0040/0041 in prod (auto-migration
> hook PR #238 is **open, not merged**), arm the inference budget gate
> (`BUDGET_GATE_ENABLED`), and wire real collection (Dhanam `/billing/checkout`
> endpoint + Tulana usage reporter). Prior 2.4.0 gates remain — manual prod
> deploy gate, OTel/Sentry on `inference-gateway`, branch protection on
> `main`, per-product AI attribution, PUBLIC-repo state, and the missing
> RFC 0031 / 0034 files — see
> [docs/OPERATOR_BACKLOG.md](docs/OPERATOR_BACKLOG.md) Tier 7.

### Prior status: v2.4.0 — RFC 0034 metering + realtime-office stabilization (2026-07-18) ✅

> Seven PRs (#222–#229) merged to `main` on 2026-07-18. The USD usage ledger
> now accrues (was recording zeros), streaming inference is metered, and the
> **virtual office is joinable — verified end-to-end in prod** on
> `selva.town/demo` (Room + API green, DemoSimulator agents narrating). The
> `/v1` inference proxy was extracted into its own **`inference-gateway`**
> production Deployment (RFC 0034 P2), so Selva now runs **7 Deployments**
> (admin, colyseus, gateway, inference-gateway, nexus-api, office-ui,
> workers). New tropical solarpunk day/night UI foundation is live. See
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[2.4.0]`.

### Prior status: v2.3.0 + Phase 2 campaigns + Phase 0 remediation (2026-05-30) ✅

> Phase 2 campaign orchestration **shipped** (#179): API, worker graph,
> materializer, office-ui Campaign Dashboard. Staging API loop proven.
> **Next:** [PHASE_0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md](docs/PHASE_0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md)
> (OTel/Sentry, Dhanam catalog, k6 Run 4b, DR drill, prod promote).

## Roadmap to Production-Truthful (post v2.2.0)

After the v2.2.x security + UX remediation pass landed (see commits
on chore/full-remediation; merged to main as one combined PR), the
platform is roughly 88-92% of "fully production stable + data-truthful."
The remediation closed the most weaponizable holes (worker token
cross-tenant bypass, webhook fail-open, ledger forgery, email From:
spoofing, artifact path traversal). The remaining gap is now mainly
operational proof and cross-service reliability:
schema migration discipline, cross-service alignment, operational
maturity, and real load + chaos testing.

This roadmap sequences the next 6-10 weeks of work to close that gap.

### Phase 1 — high-leverage, low-design (1-2 weeks)

These are mechanical fixes blocked only by execution time. Each is
foundationally one-line dangerous if left undone.

- ~~**Postgres RLS rollout**~~ — DONE (Phase 1 layer). Migration 0025
  enables RLS on 18 tenant-scoped tables with policies that filter by
  `current_setting('app.current_org_id', true)`. `database._set_session_org_id`
  sets the variable from the auth context's `org_id_var` ContextVar on
  every request via `get_db`. Permissive escape hatch (NULL/empty
  session org → policy permits) covers Alembic / healthchecks / demo
  paths. SQLite test paths no-op cleanly. Closes the entire class of
  "missed `.where(org_id == tenant.org_id)`" bugs at the database
  layer. New Phase 1.5 entry below tightens the escape hatch after
  production observation.
- ~~**12 remaining webhook handlers hardened**~~ — DONE for 11 of them
  (Telegram, Slack, Matrix, Mattermost, Twilio SMS, DingTalk, Feishu,
  WeCom, Weixin, BlueBubbles, HomeAssistant) via the new `_require_secret()`
  helper at the top of each handler. Each now returns 503 on empty
  secret, mirroring the v2.2.x Discord/WhatsApp/generic pattern. New
  Settings fields (`dingtalk_app_secret`, `feishu_app_secret`,
  `wecom_token`, `weixin_app_token`, `bluebubbles_password`, `ha_token`)
  give those handlers a single source of truth instead of `getattr`
  fallback. 11 new parameterized regression tests pin the contract.
  (12th item — `email_inbound` — uses an allow-list pattern, not a
  shared secret; intentionally left for a separate PR with its own
  threat model review.)
- ~~**Gateway → Celery SSRF gap**~~ — DONE (defense-in-depth).
  `run_acp_workflow_task` now re-validates the target URL at
  task-start time using the same `_validate_webhook_url` the gateway
  used at admission. Narrows the DNS-rebinding window from minutes
  (queue dwell) to seconds (Celery dequeue). The workflow's internal
  `requests.get` inside `ACPAnalystNode` is still vulnerable to a
  fast-rebinding attacker — Phase 2 follow-up threads pre-resolved
  IP through the workflow node's HTTP call sites.
- ~~**`@colyseus/core` 0.17 migration**~~ — DONE. `Room<{ state: OfficeStateSchema }>`
  metadata-object pattern + `onLeave(client, code?: number)` signature.
  Local `RoomOptions` interface renamed to `OfficeJoinOptions` to avoid
  collision with the colyseus base type. 166/166 colyseus tests pass.
- ~~**Office-ui WebSocket clients add `?token=`**~~ — DONE.
  `useEventStream` and `useApprovals` now read the JWT from
  `getSessionToken()` and append `?token=<jwt>` to the WS URL.
  Connection is gracefully skipped when no token is available
  (unauthenticated path or demo mode). 2 new tests pin the contract.
- ~~**Stripe webhook handler**~~ — DONE. Scaffold at
  `/api/v1/stripe/webhook` verifies signatures via
  `stripe.Webhook.construct_event` with 300s replay-tolerance.
  Fail-closed on missing `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (503).
  Settings validator refuses empty secret when
  `FEATURE_STRIPE_MXN_LIVE=true` in production. **Per-event handlers
  shipped** in PR #116: `customer.subscription.{created,updated,deleted}`
  + `invoice.{paid,payment_failed}` mirror state into `tenant_configs`
  via migration 0027 (`stripe_customer_id` UNIQUE+indexed lookup),
  refresh cached tier limits, and emit `billing.invoice_paid` /
  `billing.payment_failed` task events. 22 regression tests pin the
  contract. Operator follow-up: configure Stripe price→tier mapping in
  **Dhanam** and point webhooks at Selva `/api/v1/billing/webhooks/dhanam`
  before enabling live billing (`BILLING_VIA_DHANAM=true`, default). The
  verifier now has strict `--require-all` mode for canonical tier coverage
  plus `PRODUCT_WEBHOOK_URLS` evidence.
- **Production secrets provisioned** — `WORKER_API_TOKEN`,
  `CONSENT_LEDGER_SIGNING_SECRET`, `COLYSEUS_SERVICE_TOKEN` all need
  strong values in staging + prod. Settings validators now refuse
  weak / dev defaults in production environment.
- **OTel exporter actually wired** — `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is
  read but no-op when unset. Pick a backend (Honeycomb / Tempo /
  Datadog), wire the env var, then run
  `./scripts/verify-observability-trace.sh --require-trace` with read-only
  Tempo/Grafana query credentials to prove a generated dispatch trace landed.
  **Vendor decision pending operator review** — see
  [docs/OBSERVABILITY_VENDOR_SELECTION.md](docs/OBSERVABILITY_VENDOR_SELECTION.md)
  (recommendation: Grafana Cloud Free → Pro for traces+logs+metrics).
- **Sentry DSN per service** — `init_sentry()` exists and Office UI
  source-map upload is wired through Docker/GitHub when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
  + `SENTRY_ORG` are set. Remaining operator work: create real Sentry
  projects/DSNs, configure `SENTRY_DSN_*` + CI upload credentials, and
  capture synthetic staging/prod errors. **Vendor decision pending operator
  review** — same doc as above (recommendation: stay with Sentry Team plan
  EU region, $26/mo).

### Phase 1.5 — RLS tightening (after 1-2 weeks of production observation)

- **Audit every code path that runs without `org_id_var` set** — the
  Phase 1 RLS policies use a permissive escape hatch (NULL/empty
  session org → policy permits) so Alembic / healthchecks / demo /
  unauthenticated paths keep working. After observing production
  query patterns, enumerate every legitimate "no tenant context"
  path and either: (a) set an explicit context (e.g. "platform" for
  MADFAM-internal queries), or (b) document each one.
  **First fix landed (PR #114)**: `POST /api/v1/swarms/tasks/reap-stale`
  was silently scoped to one org because it inherited the caller's
  `org_id` via `Depends(get_db)` and the permissive RLS policy then
  filtered to that org only. Now requires a service/worker/platform/admin
  role and explicitly resets `app.current_org_id = ''` for the
  cross-tenant SELECT. The Phase 1.5 audit doc tracks the rest of the
  endpoints that need similar treatment before the permissive escape
  hatch is removed (see `docs/RLS_PHASE_1_5_AUDIT.md`).
- **Tighten the policies** — remove the `IS NULL OR = ''` branch and
  require an explicit session org on every query against a tenant
  table. Migrations should set `app.current_org_id = 'system'` and
  the policy should permit `'system'` as the platform-internal
  bypass.
- **`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`** — apply policies to the table owner
  role too, so a compromised superuser can't bypass via direct SQL.
  Requires migration scripts to use a non-owner role or explicit
  `SET ROLE` to a non-bypass role.

### Phase 2 — mid-leverage, more design (next month)

- **Tenant onboarding UI for outbound identity** — DONE (migration 0026).
  `outbound_user_email`, `outbound_user_name`, `outbound_agent_slug`
  are now first-class `tenant_configs` columns with a PUT endpoint
  (`PUT /api/v1/onboarding/tenant-identity`) and an office-ui form
  at `/settings/outbound-identity`. The GET endpoint prefers the new
  columns over the legacy fallback chain
  (brand_name / razon_social / tenant_identities); the legacy chain
  still applies when the new columns are NULL so existing tenants
  remain unaffected.
- **Schema codegen TS↔Python** — 29 Python ORM models, ~7 TypeScript
  shared-types interfaces. Frontend hooks call uncovered endpoints with
  `Record<string, unknown>` ad-hoc shapes. Pipeline: `datamodel-code-generator`
  generates JSON Schema → `json-schema-to-typescript` emits TS. CI fails
  on drift.
- **AUDIENCE_FILTER_ENABLED=true** — currently shadow-mode (default
  `false`). After 24-48h observation in production confirms the
  shadow-block log is empty, flip the gate so platform-only tools
  actually refuse tenant invocations. **Rollout plan ready** — see
  [docs/AUDIENCE_FILTER_ROLLOUT.md](docs/AUDIENCE_FILTER_ROLLOUT.md)
  (synthetic-exercise procedure pre-launch; full 48h soak when first
  paying tenant onboards).
- ~~**Mypy baseline elimination — nexus-api**~~ — DONE (waves 1, 1.5, 3).
  144 → 0 in `apps/nexus-api/`. CI ratchet at `MAX_MYPY_ERRORS=0`.
  Surfaced 4 latent bugs along the way (wrong `adapters.compliance`
  import path, missing `await` on `KarafielAdapter.get_cfdi_status`,
  invalid `tags=s.tags` attr access, stale type ignores).
- ~~**Mypy baseline elimination — workers**~~ — DONE (PR #115).
  14 → 0 in `apps/workers/`. CI ratchet at `MAX_MYPY_ERRORS=0`.
  Added `_state_str` / `_state_dict` helpers for type-safe access on
  loosely-typed graph state dicts. Documented latent
  `PostgresSaver.from_conn_string` bug (every worker silently uses
  `MemorySaver` because the `.setup()` call always raises
  `AttributeError` caught by the broad except — needs a follow-up to
  open a real `psycopg.Connection` and pass it to the
  `PostgresSaver(conn=...)` constructor with worker-shutdown plumbing).
- **Mypy baseline elimination — packages** — IN PROGRESS (PRs #117 +
  #118). 129 → 47 in `packages/` (down 82 in 2 stacked PRs). CI
  ratchet to be set at the post-merge count. Surfaced 6 latent silent
  bugs: `InferenceProvider.stream` async-vs-async-generator signature
  mismatch (every streaming caller broke at type check); `agent.py`
  `call_llm` called with wrong arg shape and missing `await` since
  written; 3 SDK examples (`basic_dispatch.py`, `custom_workflow.py`,
  `list_agents.py`) using dict indexing on pydantic models — would
  crash on first real run; `meeting_scheduler.py` loop variable `e`
  shadowing an `except ValueError as e` (Python deletes the except
  name at scope exit). Remaining 47 errors are concentrated in
  langgraph type-system mismatches (`StateGraph.invoke` not yet
  typed), `Client | None` union-attr noise, and one
  `selva_memory.store.Base not valid as type` issue worth a closer
  look — the 5/week rate target should burn down to <20 within a
  couple weeks.
- **Real load test** — target 100 concurrent SwarmTasks; measure DLQ
  depth, worker pool saturation, Redis Stream lag, LLM provider rate
  limits hit. Calibrate `MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS`, `dispatch_rate_limit`,
  `TIER_DAILY_TASK_LIMIT` from data instead of guesswork.
- **Backup/restore drill** — full restore from backup in staging;
  measure RTO; document RPO; verify off-site/cross-region storage.
  `Makefile` has `db-backup` / `db-restore` targets but no evidence
  of regular testing.
- **SLO definitions + dashboards** — target latency p50/p95/p99 per
  endpoint class; error budget; SLI dashboard. Today there are no SLOs
  documented anywhere.
- **Alert wiring** — DLQ depth, error rate, consent-ledger-grants
  invariant violation, JWKS fetch failures, LLM provider failures,
  Redis pool saturation. Page on-call for criticals.
- **Test coverage to 75%** on critical paths (auth, swarms.dispatch,
  email tools, voice-mode gate, consent ledger, worker org-scoping).
  Security regression tests landed in v2.2.x; broader coverage still
  needed.

### Phase 3 — architectural (next quarter)

- ~~**Audit trail completeness — in-Selva**~~ — DONE. Waves 1+2+3
  (PRs #130, #131, #133) closed all 37 mutation sites identified in
  `docs/AUDIT_TRAIL_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` plus the new `bulk_expire`
  endpoint. **Cross-service replacement** for the manual
  `emit_event_db` discipline is RFC 0019 (PR #140) — Postgres CDC
  (Debezium → Kafka → audit topic). 4-phase 10-week migration plan;
  operator decisions blocking start: Kafka cluster ownership +
  ~$300-800/mo cost approval.
- ~~**Idempotency tokens**~~ — DONE. Helper shipped in PR #127.
  Adopted on 10 mutation endpoints across PRs #141 (Tier 1 — dispatch,
  approve, deny, voice-mode) + #142 (Tier 2 — marketplace.install,
  calendar.connect, maps.create+import, workflows.create+import).
  53 regression tests pin the contract. Org-scoped Redis cache, 24h
  TTL, graceful Redis-down degradation, header-absent no-op
  (caller opt-in). Adoption checklist for new endpoints in
  CLAUDE.md "Patterns Added in v2.3.0".
- **Per-tenant data residency** — RFC 0020 (PR #144) landed.
  Recommended: hybrid Pattern A (dedicated MX-region cluster for
  SAT-bound tenants) + Pattern C (gateway-routed shards for
  everyone else), driven by new `tenant_configs.data_residency_region`
  ENUM column. Phased migration. Implementation blocked on operator
  cluster-provisioning decision.
- **Multi-region failover** — RFC 0021 (PR #144) landed.
  Recommended: active-passive (warm standby, ~30min RTO) for next
  12 months → active-active in Q1 2027 once regional infrastructure
  is mature through quarterly drills. Active-active multi-master
  rejected upfront. Implementation blocked on RFC 0020's cluster
  topology decisions.
- **Compliance audit prep** — SOC 2 Type II is a 6-12 month engagement;
  ISO 27001 similar; LFPDPPP enforcement already active per the v2.2.0
  voice-mode/consent-ledger work.
- **Pricing contract codified** — PARTIAL. Tulana decision doc →
  `infra/pricing/selva-tiers.json` (canonical, schema-validated)
  shipped. Python loader `nexus_api/billing_tiers.py` reads from JSON
  with the same exported names + same fallback semantics (zero
  behaviour change). CI drift gate
  (`tests/test_pricing_codification.py`) asserts loader + JSON +
  CLAUDE.md + emergency fallback all agree. **Remaining**: TS-side
  reader for `apps/office-ui/src/app/bundles/page.tsx` (still has
  hardcoded BUNDLES const for Founder/Operator/Flywheel composite
  bundles); Dhanam catalog API integration (when Dhanam exposes the
  fetch API the JSON becomes the bootstrap fallback only).
- **Real PMF measurement loop** — RFC 0013 widget exists; needs adoption
  tracking, score stability, composite informing tier sunsetting
  decisions automatically.

### Cross-service unknowns (need direct audit of sibling repos)

These cannot be assessed from inside selva-office:

- **Janua** — JWT signing key rotation, refresh token revocation, enterprise
  SSO `org_id` claim mapping production state
- **Dhanam** — actual tier-fetch API; whether it's the source of truth
  selva-office expects, or also fallback-driven
- **Enclii** — rollback success rate, staged rollout discipline, RFC
  0017 digest-pinning enforcement post-deploy
- **PhyndCRM** — own tenant isolation enforcement; whether activities
  from any worker are accepted or properly scoped
- **Karafiel** — Mexican SAT compliance (CFDI, RFC validation) production
  hardening
- **Tulana** — PMF measurement loop ownership and integration

### Honest scorecard (post v2.3.0 remediation)

| Dimension | Today | Target |
|---|---|---|
| App-layer tenant scoping | 95% (was 90%) | 95% |
| Cross-service tenant propagation | 90% — gateway/Colyseus service-token headers fixed in repo; rollout evidence pending | 100% |
| Postgres-layer isolation (RLS) | 95% (was 5%) | 95% |
| Outbound governance | 90% | 95% |
| Webhook signature verification | 100% (was 30%) — 15/15 fail-closed | 100% |
| Consent ledger integrity | 95% (was 90%) — per-period key rotation safe | 95% |
| Audit trail breadth (in-Selva) | 100% (was 80%) — 37/37 sites + bulk_expire | 100% |
| Cross-service audit correlation | 20% — RFC 0019 shipped, awaits Kafka | 90% |
| Type safety (Python) | 100% — all 3 trees mypy=0, CI ratchet locked | 100% |
| Type safety (TS) | 80% | 95% |
| Concurrency under load | 65% — Runs 1–4 recorded; Run 4 improved dispatch but thresholds failed; Run 4b overlay/preflight shipped, threshold evidence pending | 85% |

**Weighted overall: ~88-92% of "fully production stable +
data-truthful"** as of 2026-05-04 (v2.3.0 sprint). Staging bootstrap
(PP.4), doc-truth remediation, and DNS/tunnel fix landed 2026-05-30 —
see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [docs/PP_4_STAGING_AUDIT.md](docs/PP_4_STAGING_AUDIT.md).

**North star gap (~58–65% → 100%):** See
[docs/AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS_PROGRAM.md](docs/AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS_PROGRAM.md)
and the commercial GA contract
[docs/COMMERCIAL_GA_REMEDIATION_PLAN_2026-06-04.md](docs/COMMERCIAL_GA_REMEDIATION_PLAN_2026-06-04.md).
The sprint execution vehicle remains
[docs/PHASE_0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md](docs/PHASE_0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md).
Phase 2 API + UI shipped (#179); Phase 2 **operator gate** met on API path;
remaining gap is immediate GA correctness hardening, Phase 0
(observability, billing catalog, k6 Run 4b, DR), then Phase 1 revenue proof
and Phases 3–5.

## Factory-as-a-Product Protocol Roadmap

> **Goal**: End-to-end phygital pipeline where a customer's digital design
> becomes a quoted, manufactured, shipped, and invoiced physical product —
> entirely orchestrated by Selva agents.

### Phase F1: Autonomous Revenue Loop — Program Phase 1 🔄

> **Program mapping:** [AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS_PROGRAM.md § Phase 1](docs/AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS_PROGRAM.md#phase-1--closed-revenue-loop-3-4-weeks)

The CRM-driven email loop is deployed and security-hardened. **Code complete**
(2026-04-16); **not yet live** for revenue attribution. Waiting on Phase 0
(Stripe map, OTel) + provider credits + `FEATURE_STRIPE_MXN_LIVE`.

```
HeartbeatService (*/30 cron)
  → CRM Scraper → Hot Lead Detection

## Autonomous Revenue Loop (v2.1.0) — 2026-04-16 ✅ Code Complete

### Infrastructure Deployed
- `[x]` HeartbeatService cron (`*/30 * * * *`) with CRM scraper + auto-dispatch
- `[x]` PlaybookGuard with conditional approval bypass + financial circuit breaker ($50/day)
- `[x]` CRM graph: fetch_context → draft_communication → approval_gate → send (Resend + PhyndCRM log)
- `[x]` Resend Pro transactional ($20/mo, 50K emails, 10 domains). madfam.io verified
- `[x]` MADFAM branded HTML email template (table-based, Outlook/Gmail/Apple Mail compatible)
- `[x]` Service consumption tracking (email sends → event stream)
- `[x]` Email delivery skill definition (`packages/skills/skill-definitions/email-delivery/SKILL.md`)
- `[x]` Security hardened: dev-bypass rejected in production, proper SSO via Janua PKCE
- `[x]` Responsive UI: Phaser RESIZE mode, mobile HUD, chat compaction
- `[x]` Player spawn fix: TMJ map spawn points (not hardcoded wall tile)

### Inference Centralization
- `[x]` OpenAI-compatible proxy at `/v1/chat/completions` + `/v1/embeddings` (`inference_proxy.py`)
- `[x]` Shared `build_router_from_env()` factory (`packages/inference/madfam_inference/factory.py`)
- `[x]` Org-config ConfigMap deployed to K8s, mounted at `/etc/selva/org-config.yaml`
- `[x]` ServiceConfig model for tracking external accounts (Resend, Anthropic, DeepInfra, Stripe, etc.)
- `[x]` PhyndCRM, Fortuna, Yantra4D secrets patched for Selva inference routing
- `[x]` 196 inference tests passing (org_config + router + factory + worker wiring)

### Blocking First Revenue
- `[ ]` **Anthropic API credits** — $0 balance blocks all LLM inference. Add $20 at console.anthropic.com
- `[ ]` **Stripe live mode** — Verify `sk_live_` prefix (not `sk_test_`)
- `[ ]` Resend domain verification (9 pending — DNS records added, click "Verify" in dashboard)
- `[ ]` DeepInfra API key (optional — 13x cost reduction on volume tasks)
- `[ ]` PhyndCRM webhook registration (CRM → Selva event flow)

---

## Immediate Next Sprint (Priority Order)

1. `[ ]` **Add Anthropic credits** — Unblocks entire autonomous loop + all ecosystem AI features
2. `[ ]` **Verify Stripe live mode** — Confirm real payments can flow
3. `[ ]` **Verify Resend domains** — Expand branded email across 9 ecosystem services
4. `[ ]` **First autonomous sale** — HeartbeatService picks up lead → drafts email → sends → checkout CTA → payment
5. `[ ]` **DeepInfra API key** — 13x cost reduction ($0.23 vs $3 per 1M tokens)
6. `[ ]` **3D Voxel View** — React Three Fiber + MagicaVoxel (see `ROADMAP_3D_VOXEL.md`)

---

## Verified Client Quote Flow (Selva -> Yantra4D -> Cotiza -> ForgeSight)

Selva agents must only return client-facing fabrication quotes when the downstream services prove the quote is tenant-scoped, project-specific, and market verified.

### Priority Implementation Items

1. `[ ]` **Agent identity wiring** — Provide Selva workers with the Janua/Yantra4D and Cotiza tenant credentials needed to call the production quote path without bypassing access control.
2. `[ ]` **Strict quote tool contract** — Default client-ready quote generation to `require_market_verified=true`.
3. `[ ]` **Verification guard** — Refuse to return a successful client quote unless Yantra4D/Cotiza/ForgeSight response data includes `market_verified=true`.
4. `[ ]` **Reference-project E2E test** — Exercise a reference client project slug, `mode=unit`, PLA/FDM, MXN, and a safe test client.
5. `[ ]` **Dependency hygiene** — Ensure local and CI environments install the Selva tool dependencies required for quote-tool execution.
6. `[ ]` **Runbook** — Document the quote flow, expected failures, credentials, and Enclii verification commands.

### Acceptance Gate

The Selva quote tool returns success for a client quote only when the final response contains a verified ForgeSight market context. Otherwise, Selva must return a non-client-ready failure with the exact blocker.
