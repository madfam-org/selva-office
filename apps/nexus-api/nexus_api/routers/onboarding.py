"""Onboarding API — voice-mode selection and consent ledger writes.

The outbound voice mode controls how the Selva office represents itself
when sending email, SMS, or other outbound communications on the user's
behalf.  It must be explicitly chosen before any outbound send is
allowed.  Selection is recorded in the append-only `consent_ledger`
(UPDATE/DELETE revoked from the app role at the DB level — see migration
0018).

The three modes:

- **user_direct** — outbound sends authored by agents go out *as the
  user*, from the user's own mailbox/number, with no AI disclosure.
  Legally the riskiest mode (see California BOT Act SB-1001 risk for
  commercial/transactional contact with CA residents, and CASL sender-
  identification obligations in Canada).  Requires explicit typed
  confirmation of the heads-up clause.
- **dyad_selva_plus_user** — outbound sends are jointly attributed
  ("Selva on behalf of <user>"). Lowest legal risk, highest brand
  clarity.
- **agent_identified** — the agent sends from
  `{agent-slug}@selva.town`, disclosing itself as a Selva agent acting
  for the org.  Requires the SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment to `selva.town`.

The `clause_version` string is the versioned identifier for the legal
copy the user agreed to.  Incrementing the version forces a re-consent
cycle for existing users.
